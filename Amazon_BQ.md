### Why Amazon?
For the me there are two main reasons.
Firstly, Amazon is among top 4 technical companies in the world. It provides wide opportunities for engineers working in complex project, aiming to give consumers the ultimate experience. Every product announced by Amazon can influence thousands of people. I have to say Amazon is the most customer centric company in the world at the same time. If I can contribute to project related these product, I will be really proud and happy.
The second impressive thing about amazon is that it grows so fast. Amazon is not just a retail company, it also anounced a wide range of product like, Alexa, Kindle-Ebook Reader, There are so many fantastic technologies and products here. Working in Amazon will never make people feel boring, and they are touching with new ideas every day. If I have the chance to join this organization, I will also learn and grow very fast.
- case 1: One of my favorite product is the E-Book reader made by amazon. I use it for reviewing my class notes and read e-books. It is such a great feeling that with a single device to store all the books I want to read. The screen can protect our eyes very well. I really like it.
- case 2: 


### Why you choose this position?
The job I have applied is the software development engineer. The reason why I choose this position is that I have many experience in software. During my intership at Alibaba, I worked there as a software engineer and participated in developoing many commercial products of client side. These experience can help me fit this position in Amazon very well, because Alibaba is a company who is very similar with Amazon. Also, as a software engineer, the work is very flexible, and nearly every field need the software engineer. We can multiple chances to participate in so many different project. 
- case 1: one product I have participated in is Cainiao Box The Cainiao Box is actually a smart locker to provide a safe palce for people leave delieveries when the user are not at home. in that product, I was mainly responsible for is embedded software development. I also need to help design the hardware architecture for that product. With the techonology of Bluetooth Low Energy, it can have a great battery power of two years. And it will make the consumer have the great experience of delievering.
- case 2: another product is the t


### The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?

The biggest mistake I have made is during my internship.
- case 1: I remembered when I was developing the demo of the Cainiao Box(a smart locker for package delieveies). I pay so much attention to details, and want to make everything become perfect, but actually it is not possible to do it in a short period. Making the product perfect is a slow process, and engineers need to do lot of testing and find the potential malicious programs. Especially, when I was design the software interface for these hardware devices of Cainiao Box, and everday when I reviewing my code, I will have some ideas to optimize the code. In result, I didn't notice that I don't have enough time to finish all the details. There are other teammates are waiting for my outcomes to do test their Android Application of interacting with the Cainiao Box. They need my outcomes to test the stability of communications. My progress will limit their progress as well. The demo neary miss the deadline. From this mistake, I learnt that details are definitely important, but I also need to pay attention to the whole schedule, I need to always keep good communication with my teammates when I have my plan. I need to make sure that my progress won’t affect other’s schedule. 

- case 2: when I was developing a remmender system to recommend musics for users. The mistake is about documentation. So it needs the keras (a high level framework enables people build the neural network quickly) framework to build the neural network to do music recommendation. But when the keras change its version, the interface also changes a lots. I didn't document the version of Keras, I have used in my project. So after setting up the environment, my teammates want to run it in a brand new and more powerful computer. When he finish setting up the runing environment there are many wired runtime error happens and but it runs perfect on my computer. I spent lots of time to check the log file and my code. In the end, it is because I forget to point out the correct version of Keras the project need to use, and my teammate install the a different version. Thie mistak really waste our time to check. It can be easily avoid by having good documentation about every thing. After that, I do the documentation very carefully.

### Most challenging project
the most challenging project I have done definitely is the Cainiao Box. We create the cainiao box aims to provide a security place for people to leave delieveries when they are not at home. It interact with smartphone using Bluetoot communcation. AS A hardware device directly interact with the consumes, engineer have to think carefully on every steps them made in the devlopment. It is a very complex project. The project need people with multi discplinary background. The mechanical engineers, user experience designer and embedded engineers, and android application developers. They need to cooperate tightly. How to perfect combine different parts together and provide the consumers with the best product experience is really tricky. 
- For example, when tesing with the Bluetooth communication between the locker and smart phones, the errors can happenss in the bluetoot communication. The issue can lies on either side the Bluetooth Firmware or on the Android Application. It really hard to debug. I have to use some sniffer to grad the bluetooth packets in the air, and analyze them one by one to check which side send the wrong command or information. 
- For example, the internal space design, they have to consider the shape and thickness of the PCB board. They also have to consider the materials of that box. For electrical engineers they need carefully design the attenna. For the firmware engineer, we have to do lots of testing to ensure we eliminate all the problems. If we didn’t do that carefully, it will influence the bluetooth signal strength and the system would not have a great responsiveness. I don’t think that consumers would like to see that the locker react to the command after several seconds.


### Couldn’t finish tasks before deadline

If I couldn’t finish tasks before deadline, I will discuss with my colleagues, trying to figure out a way that can improve the efficiency and If necessary, I will use my private time to keep working on the task. After all, finishing the task with high quality as soon as possible is what we want. I’ll never sacrifice the customer experience or the quality of the product because of that. Customer experience is always the most important. We must make sure that the product I delivered is qualified. We can sacrifice our own time to try to finish the tasks. 
If we still can not finish the tasks, we will communicate with customers and related people, to tell them why and earn their trust. At the same time, we will try our best to finish the tasks as soon as possible.
If I still couldn’t hit the date, I would look at features, pick out a few with highest priority that I could finish, and then discuss about the problem with the project manager. Of course, I would apologize first and then try to discuss about the best solution to minimize the impacts. Once the project manager agrees, I would notify all the people that could be impacted by the delay.

- case 1: When I was a intern at Alibaba, I was building the real-time environment monitor for the wraehouses. Our initial requirements it do monitor the temperatur and humidity. When the project was in  progress, the customers gives some new important suggesstion for the project. The user want it to support more sensor and they want these sensors and be easily attached to the hardware. And the thourgh simple re-configurtion on the softwrae side, it can send data from new sensor to the cloud. After having a meeting, we think the suggestoin is very imporant. But now it is seems hard to us to finish it on time.


### what you’d do after you realized you couldn’t hit the date? A time when you have to deal with a tight deadline ? 
First, I’d check every possible way that could possibly make me hit the date, like using after-work time, weekends, or holidays, asking for help or suggestions, finding alternatives or simpler solutions, etc. Since I am the owner of the tasks, it’s my responsibility to deliver results on time. It’s my fault that I underestimated the workload when I took the tasks.

If I still couldn’t hit the date, I would look at features, pick out a few with highest priority that I could finish, and then discuss about the problem with the project manager. Of course, I would apologize first and then try to discuss about the best solution to minimize the impacts. Once the project manager agrees, I would notify all the people that could be impacted by the delay.

### How do you deal with the conflict of opinions between you and your colleagues?

The conlict is usually produced by some specific technical questions. In this case, I think the best way to solve it is to show my opinions on a specific problems wiith reasonable, logically, and professional analysis. In this process that we try to convince each other, we are actually learning lots. Every conflict actually can be regarded as some form of brain storms. If his opinions or solutions is more resonable than mine, I will be very happy to accept that.

- case 1: In the process of making Cainiao Box, I have conflict with my teammates about how the authentication process will be. He recommend to use the static password setted by the user, and it will save lots of time one both server side and firmware side. For me, I think the most importance feature for Cainiao Box is security. I recommend to use the dynamic password to provide the highest security level. Once the product was shipped out, it will be used by milllions of consumers. We have a keypad on the smart locker. I provide the detailed analysis about how our schedule will be influenced by implmenting dynamic password feature. Also, I have done lots of survey about how users will expect us, and finally convince him.

So, when the smartphone want to open the box, it will send the password through bluetooth communication. If it matches the one inside of Cainiao Box, the locker will be opened.
The locker will be installed on the wall beside of the front door.

###  Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

When I start working on the cainiao box project, I worked in that group as a firmware engineer. I will work on tasks related to the low-level software development, such as buiding the drivers for hardware devices and working on the real-time oeprating system. Because, for this new project, none knows how the hardware architecture will looks like, the only thing we have is a report about user requirement. I can't start my work if I don't know what specific hardware they want to use, and they haven't finish the hiring process of hardware engineer. 
I have some experience on hardware, and I think maybe it is enough for that product, so I do lots of research and propose the hardware layout for that product. It turns out that my teammates thinks my proposal is very great. With several modifiction, they start design the hardware according to my proposal.
